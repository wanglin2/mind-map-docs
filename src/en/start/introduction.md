The official provides the many plugins, which can be introduced as needed (a certain function may not be effective because you did not introduce the corresponding plugin).

## Repository Catalog Introduction

1.`simple-mind-map`

This is a mind map library that is framework-agnostic and can be used with
frameworks such as Vue and React, or without a framework.

2.`web`

This is an online mind map built using the `simple-mind-map` library and based
on `Vue2.x` and `ElementUI`. Features include:

- Toolbar, which supports inserting and deleting nodes, and editing node
      images, icons, hyperlinks, notes, tags, and summaries
- Sidebar, with panels for basic style settings, node style settings,
      outline, theme selection, and structure selection
- Import and export functionality; data is saved in the browser's local
      storage by default, but it also supports creating, opening, and editing
      local files on the computer directly
- Right-click menu, which supports operations such as expanding, collapsing,
      and organizing layout
- Bottom bar, which supports node and word count statistics, switching
      between edit and read-only modes, zooming in and out, and switching to
      full screen, support mini map

Provide document page service.

3.`dist`

The folder containing the packaged resources for the `web` folder.

## Introduction to Warehouse Branches

- `main`: Main branch, the branch where the current release version is located;

- `feature`: Development branch, the branch currently under development. If you want to submit 'pr', please submit to that branch;

## Special Note

When applying this project to actual projects, please first experience in depth whether it can meet your needs.

This project may not have fully tested every function point, so there may be bugs. In addition, when the number of nodes is very large, there may be some performance issues. Because everyone can accept different levels of congestion, you can test the maximum number of nodes yourself. Generally speaking, within 500 nodes, it is more smooth, while over 1000 nodes have more noticeable lag.

In v0.10.4+version, a performance mode has been added to only render nodes within the visible area of the canvas, which can improve rendering speed under large data volumes. You can experience it by turning on the 'openPerformance' instantiation option, and in the online demo, you can turn on the 'Basic Styles' - 'Enable Performance Mode' switch.

If you have suggestions or find bugs, you can submit [issues](https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map/issues) here.

The built-in themes and icons in the project part come from:[Baidu Mind Map](https://naotu.baidu.com/)、[Zhixi Mind Map](https://www.zhixi.com/)。Respect the copyright, and do not use the theme and icons directly for commercial projects.

## Why not？

1.[Zhixi](https://www.zhixi.com/)

Zhixi is a free mind mapping product that supports multi end synchronization. The UI design is beautiful and the features are complete, but it is not open source, so it can only be used as a user and cannot be used in your project.

There are many other online mind mapping products similar to Zhixi, such as [GitMind](https://gitmind.cn/)、[MindLine](http://www.mindline.cn/)、[MinMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/zh)、[Mubu](https://mubu.com/) and so on, There are many searches on search engines, but these products either require fees or are developed by small companies, and their stability and sustainability cannot be guaranteed. Of course, the most crucial thing is that they are not open-source.

2.[kityminder-core](https://github.com/fex-team/kityminder-core)

`kityminder-core` is an open source brain mapping tool developed by Baidu. It has powerful functions and good performance, but it is no longer maintained. Therefore, the code is relatively old, and the interface beauty is relatively ordinary. In addition, bugs can only be fixed by yourself, and the functions can only be developed by yourself. It has high requirements for front-end development capabilities.

3.[jsmind](https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind)、[Mind-elixir](https://github.com/ssshooter/mind-elixir-core)、[my-mind](https://github.com/ondras/my-mind)、[blink-mind](https://github.com/awehook/blink-mind)、[remind](https://github.com/luvsic3/remind)、[vue3-mindmap](https://github.com/hellowuxin/vue3-mindmap)、[ZMindMap](https://github.com/zyascend/ZMindMap)、[mindmaptree](https://github.com/RockyRen/mindmaptree)...

These open-source mind maps are also good, each with its own characteristics, but they also have certain drawbacks, such as stopping updates, average interface aesthetics, less functionality, relying on a certain framework, and so on.

In summary, in open-source mind maps, it is difficult to find a better choice than `simple-mind-map`. Of course, `simple-mind-map` is far from being the best, and it also has many shortcomings. However, `simple-mind-map` has always been in a fast iteration process, and we welcome you to join and improve it together.
